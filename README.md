The mighty attempt of creating our Tearoom game in OpenGL.

# Todos
- Generalise frustums (and frustum culling)
- Add frustum culling to lights
- Add 2D texture environmental material
    - Add frustum culling here as well
- Debug environmental maps (and their framebuffers?) so that they are finally completely working and bug-free
- Unify keyboard/mouse handling (add per-stateID callback and state sorting  so that everything works just and only when it should)
- Implement multithreading for fixed physical updates
- Implement a better bloom effect
